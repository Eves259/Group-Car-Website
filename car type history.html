    <div class="item-2"><p id="p-one">In the early 1960s, Lee Iacocca, vice president and general manager of Ford, envisioned a sporty youth-market car based on the compact Falcon. Developed in record time on a shoe-string budget, Ford introduced the 1965 Mustang at the World's Fair on April 17, 1964, to instant acclaim. The original engine lineup consisted of a 170-cid straight-six, 4.3-liter V-8, and the legendary 289-cid V-8 with up to 271 horsepower. For late '65, the six was enlarged to 3.3 liters and the 260 was replaced by a 289 with a two-barrel carburetor. The Mustang roared into 1966 with only minor changes, and on March 1 of that year, Ford built the millionth Mustang. The Mustang continued to grow in size with every new model.</p></div>

    <div class="item-4"><h1 id="h-one">Dodge Challenger</h1></div>
    <div class="item-5"><p id="p-one">The name Challenger was first given to the Dodge Coronet released in 1959. The car was a special edition called Dodge Silver Challenger, and it didnâ€™t exactly look like a typical muscle car. The demand for longer and more powerful cars was growing each day. This prompted Dodge to start developing the first Challenger. The Challenger was first introduced in the fall of 1969. The Challenger Coupe was introduced in 1971, and it came with several improvements when compared to the first series. For instance, the front grille featured a different design. The first generation Challenger was discontinued. A second-generation Challenger was brought back in 1978. The modern Challenger was brought back in 2008. </p></div>

    <div class="item-7"><h1 id="h-one">Chevy Camaro</h1></div>
    <div class="item-8"><p id="p-one">To create the Camaro, Chevrolet started with the compact Chevy II Nova, it was a belated response to Ford's Falcon. In much the same way that the first Mustang is mostly a Falcon under its skin, the first Camaro is mostly Nova bits. That includes its hybrid structure of a unibody with a front subframe. But while Novas like this '65 were in production as the F-car was being developed, the Camaro would be based on the upcoming second-generation Chevy II that would appear as a '68 model. The first Camaro went on sale in September 1966 with a base price of $2466. Just over 220,000 were sold that first year.</p></div>
