    <div class="item-2"><p id="p-one">The Ford Motor Company was founded in 1903 in Detroit, Michigan, as the joint project of the businessman Henry Ford and 11 more investors. It was hard to produce cars until Ford came up with the idea of an assembly line. It gave Ford a huge boost and allowed the company to sign multiple contracts with both state authorities and private enterprises, including a cooperation agreement with the Russian Government back in 1929. The Ford Motor Company kept growing decade by decade, turning into one of the worldâ€™s largest car manufacturers. Today, it is the second biggest automaker in the US.</p></div>

    <div class="item-5"><p id="p-one">During the early 1900s, the name Dodge became a household name among consumers in our American culture. It was founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s, Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies for Detroit-based automakers, most notably Ford, and began building complete automobiles under the "Dodge Brothers" brand in 1914. Dodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, though is also made compact cars like the Charger. The company was sold to Chrysler in 1928, 8 years after the Dodge brothers died.</p></div>

    <div class="item-7"><h1 id="h-one">Chevrolet</h1></div>
    <div class="item-8"><p id="p-one">On November 3, 1911, Swiss race car driver and automotive engineer Louis Chevrolet co-founded the "Chevrolet Motor Company" in Detroit with William C. Durant and investment partners William Little. One of the technical advancements Chevrolet benefited from was the implementation of an overhead valve engine. Chevrolet continued into the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s competing with Ford. Chevrolet had a great influence on the American automobile market during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the standard Chevrolet, particularly the deluxe Impala series, became one of America's best selling lines of automobiles in history.</p></div>
